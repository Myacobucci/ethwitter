# ETHwitter

This project hosts a smart contract used to store ethweets and a webapp that let's you send them. It's meant to be a super simple version of Twitter using the Rinkeby blockchain. It was built following the course of Buildspace (and adding some custom features): "Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts".
